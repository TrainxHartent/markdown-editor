  > Just make little strokes like that. You can bend rivers. But when I get home, the only thing I have power over is the garbage. We don't have to be concerned about it. We just have to let it fall where it will. Now we'll take the almighty fan brush. Even trees need a friend. We all need friends. You can do it. - [Bob Ross](https://www.bobrosslipsum.com/)
